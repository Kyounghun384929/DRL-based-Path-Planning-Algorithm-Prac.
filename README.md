# Reinforcement Learning-based Path Planning Algorithms Repository

This repository aims to implement path planning algorithms based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL).

It addresses the problem of an agent navigating to a goal in simple 2D and 3D grid environments.  
Currently, agents are trained using the DQN (Deep Q-Network) and PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) algorithms.

# Key Files
- `src/envs/`: Implementations of 2D and 3D grid environments
- `src/algorithms/`: Implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms
- `train.py`: Train agents
- `test.py`: Evaluate and visualize trained agents

# Usage
1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Train an agent
   ```bash
   python train_*.py
   ```
   Replace `*` with the desired algorithm (e.g., `dqn`, `ppo`).
   
3. Evaluate an agent
   ```bash
   python test.py --model_path path_to_trained_model.pth
   ```
